# Sign Language Two-Way Communication

This project presents a two-way communication system designed to bridge the communication gap between sign language users and non-signers. It enables real-time translation of sign language gestures to text/speech and vice versa, providing an accessible medium for inclusive communication.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Sign to Text Translation**: Real-time sign language recognition from video input and conversion to text.
- **Text to Sign Translation**: Converts entered text into sign language video sequences for better understanding by sign users.
- **Real-Time Communication Interface**: Allows live interaction between sign language users and others.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Can be expanded for multilingual support and larger gesture datasets.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Streamlit / Tkinter / Web Interface
- **Backend**: Python (TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV)
- **Models Used**: BiLSTM | GRU | Vision Transformer (ViT)
- **Dataset**: Custom sign language video dataset with labeled glosses
- **Others**: ffmpeg, pandas, sklearn
